# Dataset Folder

This folder contains datasets used in the research paper. The datasets included are OCTA500, CORN, DRIVE, CHASEDB1, and DCA1. Please note that the images in these datasets may have undergone preprocessing steps, including cleaning and cropping. For example, CORN dataset has had overlapping samples between the training and testing sets removed; and some preprocessing like cropping for FOV has been applied.
