# YoloCurvSeg - segmentation of curvilinear structures with 'one-shot' weak and noisy supervision

This is the official repository for our **Medical Image Analysis** paper "YoloCurvSeg: You only label one noisy skeleton for vessel-style curvilinear structure segmentation".

[2023-09-15] The five datasets (with full annotations and noisy skeleton annotations) are totally released (in the **datasets** folder)! Five valuable benchmarks to evaluate weakly (and noisy) supervised segmentation methods.

[Note] The datasets and code will be gradually and continuously released!
